      <div class="faq-question">How to grow Cotton?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <strong>1. Soil Preparation:</strong> Cotton grows well in black, loamy, or alluvial soil with good drainage. Plow the land 2–3 times and apply organic manure.<br><br>
        <strong>2. Sowing:</strong> Sow cotton seeds between April and May when the temperature is warm. Ensure row spacing of about 75–90 cm and 25–30 cm between plants.<br><br>
        <strong>3. Irrigation:</strong> Provide irrigation every 15–20 days. Avoid water stagnation. Reduce watering after flowering to encourage boll opening.<br><br>
        <strong>4. Pest & Disease Management:</strong> Use pheromone traps and organic pesticides to prevent bollworms and aphids. Crop rotation also helps.<br><br>
        <strong>5. Harvesting:</strong> Harvest cotton when bolls burst open and turn white. Pick in dry weather and store in a clean, dry place.
